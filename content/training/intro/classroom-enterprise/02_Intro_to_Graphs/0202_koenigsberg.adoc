Path finding -> There was no route

== TODO: Other graph examples
 
- Facebook / Twitter / Social Network
- Navgiation / Routing / Logistics
- git
- recommendations

== And in my domain?

(Motivation for typical enterprise domains)

== Example: Enterprise

Textual description of domain

== Exercise: Create a domain model

== Domain model

== In a relational world

- Define tables / typical cases n:m, hierarchy, 1:n
- tables with data

== and as a graph?

- same data as graph
- object model
- two persons
- their attriubtes
- relationship person to organizational units
- properties of relationship
- nodes of different types -> label

== Property graphs

- nodes have labels and properties
- relationships have types/labels and properties
- picture with highlighting of different elements

== Relational database vs. graph database

pictures

== Exercise
