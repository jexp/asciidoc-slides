== And in my domain?

* Nearly any information can be represented as graph
* What about information systems in your company?
* Which domains make perfectly sense to represent as graph?
* And which do not?

== Our sample domain for today

Today we will deal with entities present in typical enterprise scenarios:

* People and Organizations
* Organizational structures, projects and teams

== Our Approach

* Entities and Use-Cases
* Identify some interesting aspects of the domain model
* Show and quickly discuss domain model choices

=== Relational

* Ask: Aspects of relational physical model
// JOIN-tables, schema, pk <- fk, nullable columns, fk-constraints, 
* Show & explain relational model
* Discuss what works well in a relational model, and what not so much

=== Graph

* Ask: Aspects of graph model
* Introduce Property Graph Model
// nodes & relationships with properties, nodes with labels, rels with name and direction
* Show & explain graph model
* Discuss what works well in a graph model, and what not so much

== Description of sample domain

[options="step"]
[condensed-75]
* 'Entities' can be natural persons (humans) or legal entities (organizations)
* Legal entities are structured in hierarchical departments
* People are employees of a department and every department has a lead
* Projects belong to departments and have team member
* Entities have addresses and locations
* Persons have a day of birth and birthplaces, organizations have a tax ID 
* Addresses belong to cities, cities to countries and countries to continents
* Organizations have offices in different cities where projects take place

== Use-Cases

* Navigate organisational hierarchy
* Find offices of a company in certain locations
* Compute worktime of employees in department for all their projects
* Co-Workers, project members, department leads, superiors
* Weekly worktime across projects
* Similar project roles

== Steps: Develop domain model

* Identify entity types (maybe abstract and concrete ones)
* Define some important attributes
* Define the relations between them

== Aspects of the Relational Model

* Tables, rows and columns
* Primary Keys
* Relations via Foreign keys
* JOIN n:m tables for many-to-many relatations 
* Artificial tables to add meta info to relations

== Show Relational Model

// todo relationsal model picture (e.g. example with pk,fk, data / inheritance, ...)

[canvas-image="./img/flipchart.jpg"]
== Discuss: What works, what less so?

=== Works Well
* aggregate normalized data

== What less so?

* Manys-Join queries
* many-to-many relationships
* inheritance
* sparse table
* optional relationships
* hierarchies

== Aspects of Graph Model

* Nodes and Connections
* No Schema

== Introduction: Property Graph Model

* Nodes for entities and attributes to match over
* Labels assign roles to nodes
* Nodes have arbitrary properties

* Relationships connect nodes
* Relationships are named and directed
* Relationships also contain (mostly) qualifying properties

== Show Property Graph Model

// Example with Arrows

== (TODO) and as a graph?

- same data as graph
- object model
- two persons
- their attributes
- relationship person to organizational units
- properties of relationship
- nodes of different types -> label

[canvas-image="./img/flipchart.jpg"]
== Discuss: What works, what less so?

=== Works Well

* schema free
* inheritance with labels
* hierarchies
* optional attributes and relationships

== What less so?

* global queries
* binary data
* wide and deep traversals

== Discussion: Compare relational and graph model

* What do they have in common?
* What are differences?
* Is any of them easier to create?
* Which one feels more natural to you?
* What do you think about "schema free"?
