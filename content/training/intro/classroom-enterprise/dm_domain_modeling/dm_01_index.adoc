== And in my domain?

(Motivation for typical enterprise domains)

== Our sample domain for today

Today we will deal with entities present in typical enterprise scenarios:

* People and Organizations
* Organizational structures, projects and teams

== Description of sample domain

* 'Persons' can be natural persons (humans) or legal entities (organizations)
* Legal entities are structured in hierarchical departments
* People are employees of a department and every deparment has a lead
* Projects belong to departments and have team member
* Persons have addresses and locations
* Humans have a day of birth and birthplaces, organizations have a tax ID 
* Addresses belong to cities, cities to countries and countries to continents
* Organizations have offices in different cities where projects take place

== Excercise 1: Draw domain model

* Identify entity types (maybe abstract and concrete ones)
* Define some important attributes
* Define the relations between them

== Possible solution

* The model we had in mind:

== Relevant extract for next steps

* TODO: show simplified version
* Perhaps latern when we start with cypher

== Excercise 2: Transfer to Relational Data Model

== Relational world

* Define tables / typical cases n:m, hierarchy, 1:n
* Tables with data in rows
* Joins

== Excercise 3: Transfer to Graph Model

== Discussion: Compare relational and graph model

* What do thex have in common?
* What Are differences?
* Is any of them easier to create?
* Which one feels more natural to you?

== Now add some sample data

First remember: how is data organized in tables?

== and as a graph?

- same data as graph
- object model
- two persons
- their attriubtes
- relationship person to organizational units
- properties of relationship
- nodes of different types -> label

== Property graphs

- nodes have labels and properties
- relationships have types/labels and properties
- picture with highlighting of different elements

== Relational database vs. graph database
