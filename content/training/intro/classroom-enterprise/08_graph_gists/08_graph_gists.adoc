== What are we missing ?

A tool to:
[options=step]
* quickly sketch out graph models
* document and discuss use-cases
* incrementally build the graph
* life queries with error checking
* shareable and collaborative
* easy to write, read, manage and version

== What is a gist?

[options=step]
* A useful snippet of information
* Easy to share, fork and change
* Nicely rendered and presented

== What is a GraphGist?

=== an AsciiDoc file with:

[options="step"]
* a graph domain model (cypher)
* describing text and pictures
* some example queries checked against the model
* interactively executable (Cypher)
* a Neo4j Console for further exploration

== Power Combination of Cool Tools

[options="step"]
* AsciiDoc(tor) running in Browser with Opal.js
* Cypher
* Neo4j Console
* JavaScript (D3.js, jQuery)
* HTML5 (postMessage)
* GitHub Gists

=== The Glue? Javascript

[canvas-image="{img}/graphgist/swiss-army-knife.jpg"]
== Swiss Army Knife

== How does it work (Rendering)?

[options="step"]
. Load Gist file from GitHub Gist / Url
. Render AsciiDoc to HTML5 on the fly
. Write to page / CSS
. Placeholder replacement

== How does it work (Queries) ?

[options="step",start=5]
. Instantiate Console IFrame
. Find all setup- and use-case queries
. Send to Console, Check Results
. Render Results as Table or Graph
. Reset and Show Console
