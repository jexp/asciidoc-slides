== Who the hell is this guy?

* Michael Hunger
* Developer Advocate Neo Technology
* Love People and Graphs
* @mesirii | michael@neotechnology.com









== What will he talk about?

[options="step"]
* (Graphs)-[:LOVE]->(Whiteboards)
* (Graphs)-[:HATE]->(Text-Files)
* Ascii-Art Rocks
* Really? The GraphGist idea
* Power Combination of Cool Tools
* How does it work?
* Our Community Rocks - The GraphGist Challenge

== Question for you!

=== How to discuss/communicate your awesome graph domain model?

=== What is an easy way to present it in a modern, interactive format?

=== Draw it by hand?

=== Need a running database?

=== Or just a browser?

== (Graphs)-[:LOVE]->(Whiteboards)

[options="step"]
* The picture vs. 1000 words
* creative thinking doodles
* modeling is incremental
* ongoing discussion, refinement
* whiteboard, -walls, -tables

== (Graphs)-[:HATE]->(Text-Files)

[options="step"]
* It's the 1000 words
* Single dimensional
* No graphics
* Verbose

== But Ascii-Art Rocks

[options="step"]
* Turn text into pictures
* The Power of Symbols
* Graph Patterns Made easy
* Hacker Friendly
* Diffs, VCS

=== Setup

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (neo:Company {name:"Neo"})-[:IN]->(:Country {tld:"SE"})
CREATE (:Person {name:"Peter",age:40})-[:WORKS_AT]->(neo)
CREATE (:Person {name:"Kenny",age:23})-[:WORKS_AT]->(neo)
CREATE (:Person {name:"Kenny",age:23})-[:WORKS_AT]->(neo)
CREATE (structr:Company {name:"Structr"})-[:IN]->(:Country {tld:"DE"})
CREATE (:Person {name:"Axel",age:39})-[:WORKS_AT]->(structr)
CREATE (:Person {name:"Christian",age:25})-[:WORKS_AT]->(structr)
----

=== Query

[source,cypher]
----
// Count Hipsters by Country
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(:Company)-[:IN]->(c:Country)
WHERE p.age < 28
RETURN c.tld, count(p) as hipsters
----

== How do you demo it?

* We built our own sandbox

=== The Neo4j Console
++++
<iframe src="http://console.neo4j.org/r/cctayc" width="800" height="400"></iframe>
++++

== Console - Sandbox, a useful Tool

=== How does it work?

[options="step"]
* In-Memory throwaway Neo4j instances
* Simple Console UI with Graph Viz and Table Results
* One Click sharing
* Repl, SandBox, Bug-Reporter, Modeling Questions
* Tiny Webapp on Heroku

=== People love it

[canvas-image="{img}/Neo4jConsole.jpg"]

== Focus, Michael

=== What was the question again?

=== How to present a live, graph model?

== What is a gist?

* A useful snippet of information
* Easy to share, fork and change
* Nicely rendered and presented

== What is a GraphGist?

=== an AsciiDoc file with:

[options="step"]
* a graph domain model (cypher)
* describing text and pictures
* some example queries checked against the model
* interactively executable (Cypher)
* a Neo4j Console for further exploration

== Power Combination of Cool Tools

[options="step"]
* AsciiDoc(tor) running in Browser with Opal.js
* Cypher
* Neo4j Console
* JavaScript (D3.js, jQuery)
* HTML5 (postMessage)
* GitHub Gists

=== The Glue? Javascript

[canvas-image="{img}/swiss-army-knife.jpg"]
== Swiss Army Knife

== How does it work?

[options="step"]
. Load Gist file from GitHub Gist / Url
. Render AsciiDoc to HTML5 on the fly
. Write to page / CSS
. Placeholder replacement
. Instantiate Console IFrame
. Find all setup- and use-case queries

. Render Results as Table or Graph
. Reset and Show Console


== Next Step ?

=== We have a great tool for model documentation

=== Now we need some models, aka content

=== Don't make something up!

=== Ask your users, your Community

== Create a Challenge (or two)

=== First Challenge (September)

* Give me anything
* Nice Prizes (Money, Books, T-Shirts, Tickets)
